      mute, the trees, stripped of their green livery, the shortened days and
      lengthened nights, together with the piercing winds and pinching frosts,
      now show us that winter is come: stern Winter, which resembles Old Age, or
      the closing scene.

      Yet, even this season is not void of its beauties and blessings. The new
      fallen snow caps the mountains, and covers the valleys, with a white and
      beautiful vesture, which is thrown into many curious forms, folds, and
      ridges, by the rude blasts of the driving winds.
    </p>
    <p>
      What can exceed the dazzling splendour of a rising sun, on the trees and
      bushes, after a night of rain and freezing, when every branch appears like
      a shining crystal? A prospect grand indeed!
    </p>
    <p>
      The severe frosts of Winter, with the agitated atmosphere, dispel the
      sickening fumes which arise from heated and stagnant pools, and decaying
      vegetation.

      This gives health and vigour to the body, and an it were, new spring to
      thought. Who but has observed the lively sensations of body and mind on a
      clear frosty morning in winter? What a contrast to the languor experienced
      after a sultry night in summer or in autumn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although there are now no fields of corn to hoe or harvest to cut, yet the
      winter is not a scene of inactivity. It is undoubtedly the will of Heaven,
      that man should labour&mdash;The constitutions of his body and mind are so
      formed, as greatly to need it. Moderate labour tends to the health of
      both.

      The woodman, with his axe, engages the sturdy oak, which by his repeated
      strokes, bows its ancient and venerable head, and comes tumbling to the
      ground. It is then cut into suitable lengths, and carted home for the
      fire.

      The grain is now threshed out from the straw, and cleared from the chaff
      by the wind or a fan. The wheat, rye, and buckwheat, are then carried to
      the mill, ground into flour, brought home and made into bread, pies,
      cakes, &amp;c.

      Barley is used to make beer, oats to feed horses, and Indian corn for both
      man and beast.

      Much attention to the poor dumb animals is necessary, who look up to man
      for protection. The horsed cows, and sheep are to be foddered early and
      late, and provided with proper shelter.

      The hogs are to be fed and furnished with a bed of straw. The turkeys,
      geese, and ducks, with the other poultry, will flock round the little boy
      or girl, who comes with a basket of corn to feed them.

      The flax in the winter is broken with a crackle, and then dressed on a
      swingling-board by a long wooden knife: afterwards passed through a
      hatchel, and then, by the industrious country woman and her daughters,
      spun into yarn, for the purpose of making linen for our shirts, &amp;c.

      In the long winter evenings, how pleasant for a family to sit by a good
      fire, and hear the cold wind whistling without; when; neighbour enjoys the
      company of neighbour, and treats him with a drink of palatable cider, and
      some good apples; while the little children are agreeably employed in
      cracking and eating the nuts which they gathered in the fall.

      Some amuse themselves with riding in the sleigh, while the little boys
      glide swiftly, in many a curious curve, upon the ice; and, when the
      weather is foul, the little folks can suitably exercise themselves within
      doors at shuttlecock.
